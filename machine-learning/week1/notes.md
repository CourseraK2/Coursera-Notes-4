# Introduction
"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed."

## Supervised Learning

- Some 'right' answers are given and an algorithm will return more 'right' answers.
- Otherwise called a 'training set'.

Regression problem: estimate relationships for continuous data
Classification problem: discrete data

## Unsupervised Learning


- Clustering data into groups - don't give it an answer first.

Organise computing clusters, social network analysis, market segments etc.

## Notation


m = Number of training examples
x = input variable/feature
y = output variable/target
h = hypothesis 

(x,y) - one training example
(x<sup>i</sup>,y<sup>i</sup>) - i<sup>th</sup> training example

Univariate - One variable model

# Gradient Descent

Minimise some function J((theta)<sub>0</sub>,(theta)<sub>1</sub>) (cost function)
