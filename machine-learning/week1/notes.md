# Supervised Learning

"Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed."

## Supervised Learning

- Some 'right' answers are given and an algorithm will return more 'right' answers.

Regression problem: estimate relationships for continuous data
Classification problem: discrete data

## Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering data into groups - don't give it an answer first.

Organise computing clusters, social network analysis, market segments etc.
